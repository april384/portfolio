          <p>A detective investigates crimes and tries to solve them before it goes to a person with higher authority. The salary for being a detective is about 60-90k per year. You need a high school or a GED and some agencies will require a bachelor's or associate degree. Instead of getting the degree you can do an equal amount of military experience. Some skills needed to be a detective include good problem solving, critical thinking, communication, understand human behavior and psychology, and pay attention to detail.  </P>
